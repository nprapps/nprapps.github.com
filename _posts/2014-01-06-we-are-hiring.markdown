Love to code?

Want to use your skills to make the world a better place?

The visuals team (formerly known as news applications) is a crew of developers, designers, photojournalists and videographers in the newsroom at NPR headquarters in sunny Washington, DC &mdash; and we're hiring.

We work closely with editors and reporters to create data-driven news applications ([Playgrounds For Everyone](http://apps.npr.org/playgrounds/)), fun and informative websites ([NPR's Book Concierge](http://apps.npr.org/best-books-2013/)), web-native documentaries ([Planet Money Makes A T-shirt](http://apps.npr.org/tshirt/)), and charts and maps and videos and pictures and [lots of things in-between](http://blog.apps.npr.org/apps/).

It's great fun.

## We believe strongly in…
* User-centered design
* Agile software development
* Open-source software, and [being transparent in our methods](http://source.opennews.org/en-US/learning/how-and-why-cross-disciplinary-collaboration-rocks/)

## You must have…
* Experience making things for the web (We've got [a way we like to do things](http://blog.apps.npr.org/2013/02/14/app-template-redux.html), but we love to meet folks with new talents!)
* Attention to detail and love for making things
* A genuine and friendly disposition

## Bonus points for…
* An uncontrollable urge to write code to test your code
* Love for making audio and video experiences that are *of* the web, not just *on* the web
* Deep knowledge of Javascript and functional programming for the web

## Allow me to persuade you
The newsroom is a crucible. We work on tight schedules with hard deadlines. That may sound stressful, but check this out: With every project we learn from our mistakes and refine our methods. It’s a fast-moving, volatile environment that drives you to be better at what you do, every day. It's awesome. Job perks include…

* Live music at the [Tiny Desk](http://www.npr.org/series/tiny-desk-concerts/)
* All the tote bags you can eat
* A sense of purpose
