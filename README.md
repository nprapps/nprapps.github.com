==================

### Assumptions

* Ruby 2.1.0 or higher
* [Bundler](http://bundler.io/). If you don't have this, you can install it with `gem install bundler`.

### Getting Started

This blog uses a static site generator called [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to convert Markdown files into HTML.

To install Jekyll run:

```
bundle install
```

Once you have Jekyll installed, run this command to start up the development server and have it automatically regenerate files:

```
jekyll serve --watch
```

You can see it in your browser here:

```
http://localhost:4000
```

Matt Stiles wrote a [helpful post](http://blog.apps.012/11/08/npr-news-apps-blog.html) that explains a bit more about how to Jekyll builds this site.

### Things To Know

* Pushing code to the repo will automatically publish any changes you've made. If you're not ready to publish yet, save your changes to a separate branch, and then merge it back to ```master``` when you're ready.

* Writing a blog post? [Use this as a starting point.](https://github.com/nprapps/nprapps.github.com/blob/master/_posts/2013-12-10-the-book-concierge.markdown)

* Linking to a post we've written somewhere else (like Source)? [Use this as a starting point.](https://github.com/nprapps/nprapps.github.com/blob/master/_posts/2014-01-02-source-tshirt-ux.markdown)

### How To Embed Code Snippets

A couple options:

* Tab-indent your code, and Markdown will recognize it as a code snippet. However, if that snippet includes ```{{ }}``` tags, wrap the block of code in ```{% raw %} {% endraw %}``` to escape it. ([Example](https://github.com/nprapps/nprapps.github.com/commit/5ead926c125807af9a41afce80baba0628bc2aa9#diff-f81649843a7256ddce49a0cb115a3a27))

* Save your code snippet as a Gist on your GitHub account &mdash; for example, https://gist.github.com/alykat/8319004. Take the username and Gist ID in the URL and sub it into the script tag: ```<script src="https://gist.github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/GIST-ID.js"> </script>```

### Internship posting workflow

Make copies of the previous posts:

```bash
cp 2016-10-12-winter-2017-designer-developer-internship.markdown 2017-02-14-summer-2017-designer-developer-internship.markdown
cp 2016-10-12-winter-2017-photo-internship.markdown 2017-02-14-summer-2017-photo-internship.markdown
```

Add redirects to old posts by changing front matter, e.g. in `_posts/2016-10-12-winter-designer-developer-internship.markdown`:

```
---
layout: redirect
redirect_url: /2017/02/14/summer-2017-designer-developer-internship.html
title: "Be our design/code/??? intern for winter/spring 2017!"

...

---
```

Edit the new posts with new art, new links between the two (it's cool if you forget, it just means more redirect responses), and correct NPR human resources job posting URL.

Update `index.html`'s internship badge with latest links.
