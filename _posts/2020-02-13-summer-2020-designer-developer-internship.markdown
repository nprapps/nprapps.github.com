Are you data-curious, internet savvy, and interested in journalism? Do you design or write code? We are looking for you.

We've had journalists who are learning to code, programmers who are learning about journalism, designers who love data graphics and reporters who love data.

Does this sound like you? Apply to join our team! It isn't always easy, but it is very rewarding. You'll learn a ton and you'll have a lot of fun.

Our paid internship runs from June 1 to Aug. 21. **Applications are due Monday, Mar. 9 at 5 p.m. ET.**

Here are a few projects our recent interns have worked on:
