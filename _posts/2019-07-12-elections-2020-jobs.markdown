NPR Visuals has three (3) open contract positions for the 2020 elections. The length of the contract is October 2019—November 2020. We prefer a candidate who will work in our Washington, D.C. office, but we will consider remote work arrangements.

* **Interactives Developer:** Primarily front-end focus. Works on revamping the Elections results boards, share cards, maps, and any data visualizations that we would want to correlate to various geographic results (demographics, income, etc).

* **Data Pipeline Developer:** Primarily back-end focus. Concentrates on speeding up our existing pipeline, adding more flexibility for calling races and assigning results, integrating the data necessary for the above visualizations, and helps with reporting and tooling development.

* **Digital Cartography and Data Visualization Specialist:** Concentrates on developing static and interactive maps for the display of election results which can be turned into templates to reuse for other datasets. All assets we develop need to work responsively and accessibly on all platforms and mobile devices.

## What You Will Do

Your primary focus will be the 2020 elections, but you may be asked to work on other projects as well. You will work on information graphics, data visualizations and special story presentations, working in close collaboration with reporters and editors in our newsroom. The ideal candidate will have strong, demonstrable experience using HTML, CSS, front-end JS, and D3.js to build visual representations of data that work well on both desktop and mobile.

## What We're Looking For In A Teammate

You have strong news judgement and a sense for what makes a good visual story that serves the audience. Moreover, you pay close attention to detail and understand the importance of nuance, precision and ethics. The ideal candidate will have experience working in a newsroom.

You are a team player. You’re willing to collaborate in an open environment, working with people across the newsroom with a variety of skillsets and areas of expertise. You can explain and defend your ideas, and you are open to critique and alternative approaches. When offering feedback to colleagues, you can articulate story, design and code suggestions in a helpful and supportive way.

In addition to the core skills required to do your job, you might also have expertise in areas like user experience design, data analysis, cartography or working with AP election results.

You can produce quality work on deadline. We turn around projects on time scales that run from a couple hours to a couple weeks to a couple months. You need to be able to assess what approaches will best serve a given story, what work realistically can be executed in the time available and then execute that work on time.

You consider yourself a problem solver. You can dive into existing projects to provide maintenance and support. You can face unknown issues in unknown projects methodically, debugging until you find the cause of the issue, and implementing the best possible solution once diagnosed. You’re also great at documentation, whether it’s new work or modifications to existing.

You bring a critical and individual perspective to the team. NPR Visuals is committed to journalism that reflects the diversity and strength of the communities it reports to. We strongly encourage candidates from underrepresented backgrounds to apply.
