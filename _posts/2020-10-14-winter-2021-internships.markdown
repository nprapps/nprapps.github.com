Do you design or code? Do you appreciate a well-structured spreadsheet? Are you passionate about journalism? We are looking for you. We've had journalists who are learning to code, programmers who are learning about journalism, designers who love data graphics and reporters who love data. Does this sound like you? Apply to join our team! It isn't always easy, but it is very rewarding. You'll learn a ton and you'll have a lot of fun.

## [Photo Editing Intern](https://recruiting.ultipro.com/NAT1011NATPR/JobBoard/fc254a05-d68e-44c0-a2ba-267380d146ba/OpportunityDetail?opportunityId=47baa519-d8e1-4089-b925-e189622ba9c4)

This internship is an opportunity to learn more about the world of photo editing. Our goal isn’t to make you into a photo editor; we view this internship as a chance for you to **understand what it is like to be an editor and improve your visual literacy**, which can help you become a better photographer.

### What you will be doing

* **Editing:** You’ll be working closely with the Visuals Team’s photo editors on fast-paced deadlines -- we’re talking anywhere from 15 minutes to publication, to short-term projects that are a week out. You’ll dig into news coverage and photo research, learning how to communicate about what makes a good image across a range of news topics, including international, national, technology, arts and more.

* **Photography:** Depending on the news cycle, there may be opportunities to photograph DC-area assignments. You’ll work closely with a radio or web reporter while out in the field, and a photo editor will go through your work and provide feedback for each assignment.

* We also encourage each intern to create a self-directed project to work on throughout the semester.

### Who should apply

We’re looking for candidates that have a strong photojournalism background. An interest in editing, or experience with video/photo editing is a nice plus. It’s also helpful if you’ve completed at least one photojournalism-focused internship prior to applying (let us know if you have!), though it’s not necessary. A **portfolio**, however, is required.

We also want folks who can tell us what they would like to accomplish during their time at NPR. **What do you want to learn? What do you want to try?** We try to shape each internship around our intern, so we rely on **you** to tell us what goals you have for your time with us!

Visual Newscast is the engine behind daily news video at NPR, building visuals specifically for multimodal devices such as the Amazon Echo Show and Google Home. Our work starts with creating videos for the latest devices on the market, and includes feeding established platforms like Instagram, YouTube, Twitter and Facebook with a steady stream of news video. An internship on our team is an opportunity to hone your skills as a visual journalist and embrace an emerging visual platform for news. NPR has found that smart devices have been key to attracting a younger, more diverse audience, which is a core goal for NPR. We are looking for interns that can help innovate in this space.
