This is not your standard photo internship!

This internship is an opportunity to learn more about the world of photo editing. Our goal isn’t to make you into a photo editor; we view this internship as a chance for you to **understand what it is like to be an editor and improve your visual literacy**, which can help you become a better photographer.

Our paid internship runs from Jan. 13 to April 17. **Applications are due Monday, Nov. 4 at 5 p.m. ET.**

## What you will be doing

* **Editing:** You’ll be working closely with the Visuals Team’s photo editors (Nicole and Emily) on fast-paced deadlines -- we’re talking anywhere from 15 minutes to publication, to short-term projects that are a week out. You’ll dig into news coverage and photo research, learning how to communicate about what makes a good image across a range of news topics, including international, national, technology, arts and more.

* **Photography:** Depending on the news cycle, there may be opportunities to photograph DC-area assignments. This can mean you’d have one or two shoots in a week, or maybe just a couple shoots in a month. You’ll work closely with a radio or web reporter while out in the field, and a photo editor will go through your work and provide feedback for each assignment. There will also be a chance to work on portraiture and still lifes in our studio.

* We also encourage each intern to create a self-directed project to work on throughout the semester. It can be an [Instagram Story](https://www.instagram.com/stories/highlights/18100985839046937/), [video](https://www.npr.org/2013/04/12/176913038/short-and-sweet-celebrating-d-c-s-cherry-blossoms-with-haiku), [photo essay](https://www.npr.org/2016/08/05/488518797/at-the-portrait-gallery-students-tell-the-stories-that-pictures-cant), [picture show story](https://www.npr.org/sections/pictureshow/2019/08/18/736843955/finding-identity-without-gender-a-queer-photographers-journey) or anything in-between. You can work [independently](https://www.npr.org/2019/08/11/747018934/wushu-coaches-help-chinese-students-master-literacy-and-become-a-better-person) or with [another intern](https://www.npr.org/2017/11/11/563064990/6-women-veterans-recall-their-military-service-it-was-just-the-thing-to-do) or [reporter](https://www.npr.org/2019/10/06/765716441/the-lasting-legacy-of-bob-ross-and-his-colorful-world-of-happy-accidents).

You will be part of NPR’s intern program, which includes 40-50 interns each semester, across different departments. There will be coordinated training and intern-focused programming throughout the semester, which includes meeting NPR radio hosts, career development and other opportunities. As an intern, you will be treated as a member of the team. Many NPR employees are former interns and they’re always willing to help current interns.


## Eligibility

Any student (undergraduate or graduate), or person who has graduated no more than 12 months prior to the start of the internship period to which he/she is applying is eligible. Interns must be authorized to work in the United States.

## Who should apply

We’re looking for candidates that have a strong photojournalism background. An interest in editing, or experience with video/photo editing is a nice plus. It’s also helpful if you’ve completed at least one photojournalism-focused internship prior to applying (let us know if you have!), though it’s not necessary. A **portfolio**, however, is required.

We also want folks who can tell us what they would like to accomplish during their time at NPR. **What do you want to learn? What do you want to try?** We try to shape each internship around our intern, so we rely on **you** to tell us what goals you have for your time with us!
