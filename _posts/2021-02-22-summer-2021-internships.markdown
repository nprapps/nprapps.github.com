## [Photo Editing Intern](https://recruiting.ultipro.com/NAT1011NATPR/JobBoard/fc254a05-d68e-44c0-a2ba-267380d146ba/OpportunityDetail?opportunityId=4d1a5f4f-7906-41bf-9937-9f2a3bd340ce)

This internship is an opportunity to learn more about the world of photo editing. Our goal isn’t to make you into a photo editor; we view this internship as a chance for you to **understand what it is like to be an editor and improve your visual literacy**, which can help you become a better photographer.

### What you will be doing

* **Editing staff, freelance and wire photos** - You’ll be working closely with the Visuals Team’s photo editors on fast-paced deadlines – we’re talking anywhere from 15 minutes to publication, to short-term projects that are a week out. You’ll dig into news coverage and photo research, learning how to communicate about what makes a good image across a range of news topics, including international, national, technology, arts and more.
* Post-production of photos for the website
* Researching and pitching original story ideas
* Learning to assign photographers and illustrators
* Interns could be called on to create [Instagram Stories](https://www.instagram.com/stories/highlights/18100985839046937/), [videos](https://www.npr.org/2013/04/12/176913038/short-and-sweet-celebrating-d-c-s-cherry-blossoms-with-haiku), [photo essays](https://www.npr.org/2016/08/05/488518797/at-the-portrait-gallery-students-tell-the-stories-that-pictures-cant), [picture show stories](https://www.npr.org/sections/pictureshow/2019/08/18/736843955/finding-identity-without-gender-a-queer-photographers-journey) or anything in-between.

### Who should apply

We’re looking for candidates that have a strong photojournalism background. An interest in editing, or experience with video/photo editing is a nice plus. It’s also helpful if you’ve completed at least one photojournalism-focused internship prior to applying (let us know if you have!), though it’s not necessary. A **portfolio**, however, is required.

We also want folks who can tell us what they would like to accomplish during their time at NPR. **What do you want to learn? What do you want to try?** We try to shape each internship around our intern, so we rely on **you** to tell us what goals you have for your time with us!
