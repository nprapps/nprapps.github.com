## [NewsHub/Graphics Intern (Remote-optional)](https://recruiting.ultipro.com/NAT1011NATPR/JobBoard/fc254a05-d68e-44c0-a2ba-267380d146ba/OpportunityDetail?opportunityId=3af5044c-e294-43fd-9858-8229c554ba31)

For half of the internship, you will be part of the NewsHub team, where you will pitch, report and write stories for NPR’s website and learn what it takes to make those stories go big across digital platforms. For the other half of the internship, you will be embedded with the News Apps/Graphics team, focusing on graphics, data visualization and visual storytelling.

This position could be a good fit for someone experienced with graphics and data analysis who wants to improve their reporting skills, or for a reporter with some graphics experience who wants to build stronger graphics/coding chops.

This internship has the flexibility to be on site at our Washington, D.C., office, fully remote, and/or a hybrid version of the two based on the intern’s preference.

This internship is an opportunity to learn more about the world of photo editing.

On the Visuals Desk, the intern will focus on editing and commissioning visuals for stories for news, national, culture, politics and podcasts. They will also work on content for our other visuals platforms including Instagram. The Visuals Desk intern will work across the newsroom and podcasts. On the Science Desk, interns will edit and commission visuals for stories on global and domestic health, climate change and general science. As one of the largest desks at NPR, interns will have the opportunity to work with over 30 reporters, producers and editors.
