title: "2 Job Openings With NPR's News Apps Team"
description: "We're looking for a graphics editor (6-month contract/remote) and a team editor. Come join us!"
---

The News Apps team has been a pillar of NPR’s digital expression for most of the last decade, with a talented roster and alumni network of graphic designers, software developers, data analysts, illustrators, cartographers, and visually minded reporter/editors who have helped define what NPR should look and feel like on the Internet. Our work includes enterprise projects like the [White Lies visual narrative](https://apps.npr.org/white-lies/) and the experimental [Joy Generator](https://apps.npr.org/joy-generator/), large-scale data projects like the [2020 election results](https://apps.npr.org/elections20-interactive/) and the [Book Concierge](https://apps.npr.org/best-books/), and graphics-driven efforts like our [coronavirus trackers](https://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2020/09/01/816707182/map-tracking-the-spread-of-the-coronavirus-in-the-u-s).
