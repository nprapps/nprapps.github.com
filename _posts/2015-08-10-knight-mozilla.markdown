I didn’t always have a mission. For the first seven years of my career, I worked in the software industry. The work was interesting, and I had a *craft*, for sure, but not a mission. All that changed when I quit my job to become a journalist.

Our mission at NPR Visuals is to make people care. Everything we do: The things we make, our design process, and how we measure success, all flow from that mission. It's awesome.

We’re here to create empathy. To introduce you to [somebody you’ve never met](http://apps.npr.org/lookatthis/posts/publichousing/), and think for a few minutes about life in their shoes. We’re here to [open your eyes](http://apps.npr.org/borderland/) and make you give a shit.

## Are you ready for a change?

The Knight-Mozilla fellowship is an awesome opportunity — for you and for us. It’s a chance for you to change your life, to try out working in a newsroom. You'll learn a ton, and we'll learn from you.

We’re open to folks from all walks of life, but if you’re a filmmaker, graphic designer, or involved in the digital humanities, we’d especially love to hear from you. No sweat if you can’t code or haven’t reported a story before — we’ll teach you.

(As for the specific work you’ll be doing… it’s hard to say! That’s one of the joys of working in a newsroom. We work on short schedules, and news deadlines. But I can say that you’ll work with us to report and tell important, impactful, visual stories, online.)
